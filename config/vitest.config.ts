// Two suites (`util/time/__tests__/formatRelativeTime`, `modules/shared/
// dataSource/usageTrendLabels`) assert on a NEGATIVE-offset zone so that a
// UTC-vs-local bug is actually visible; on a UTC runner it is not. They used to
// pin it themselves with a top-level `process.env.TZ = ...`, which only worked
// because the `forks` pool gave every file its own process. Under `threads`
// that assignment is a silent no-op — V8 caches the zone per PROCESS and
// workers share it — so those tests would keep passing while measuring the
// machine's own zone. Pinning here keeps them honest and makes every other
// date-formatting test independent of the developer's local zone.

    // The default `forks` pool spawns one full Node process per worker
    // (cores - 1, so ~9 on a 10-core machine). Measured on this suite (1314
    // files / 10332 tests):
    //
    //   forks,   ~9 workers  ->  203 s, 2.28 GB peak, 12 processes

    //
    // Threads share one heap, so bounding them cuts peak memory by more than
    // half at the same wall time, whereas bounding forks only trades memory
    // for a 2x slowdown. `isolate` stays on (the default), so each file still
    // gets a fresh module registry — which is what the atom-graph suites below
    // actually depend on. What threads do NOT isolate is process-global state;
    // see the TZ note at the top of this file before adding a test that
    // mutates `process.env` and expects other files not to see it.
    //
    // The cap is a memory ceiling, not a tuning knob: it keeps a full-suite run
    // affordable next to a dev server and a typecheck on a 16 GB machine.
