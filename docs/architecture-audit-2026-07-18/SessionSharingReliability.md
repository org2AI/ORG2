# Cloud session sharing and fork reliability architecture audit

> **Implementation status (2026-07-17 fix batch):** All 5 must-fix and 2 should-fix items from this audit have been implemented; see the corresponding commits:
>
> - selected-agent forwarding → `fix(chat): forward selected agent into external-history continuation` (including a payload assertion for a non-default definition)
> - explicit-share double pass → `fix(cloud): run one serialized pass for explicit share and level changes` (counting test for `resumeOrgAndWait` + `startedPassCount`; both CloudSyncLevelDialog call-site pairs were migrated as well)
> - endpoint reset omitted `org2CloudPushedMetadataAtom` → `fix(cloud): wipe pushed-metadata marker on endpoint switch` (including a test that aligns the wipe set with the prune set)
> - scope-only + floor implicit upload → `fix(cloud): apply sharing floor only to admitted sessions` (the floor applies only to owned/tagged/forked sessions or sessions with explicit intent)
> - guest capability did not survive restart → `fix(cloud): durable guest share capability registry` (a zod-validated durable registry; guest rows are rematerialized after `loadSessions` replaces the full list)
> - segment content verification → `feat(collab): verify segment count and content hash before assembly` (typed `SegmentIntegrityError` + tampering test)
> - end-to-end cancellation → `feat(cloud): abortable share resolve, fetch, decode, and import`
> - evidence gap → `test(cloud): p_after_seq contract probe and rendered fork/guest evidence` (contract probe for cloud-org scenario M; dual-instance C asserts persistence of a non-default agent, and E asserts guest survival after forced refresh). Credential-gated rendered E2E still needs to run in an environment configured with `E2E_CLOUD_*`.
> - split orthogonal changes → logger, Rust prompt fixture, and Brick subtree changes were each committed separately.
>
> The should-fix for the two entitlement coordinators (roster bootstrap and Realtime each maintain their own TTL/single-flight) has not yet been consolidated into one coordinator and remains a follow-up item.

Scope: the complete managed-cloud session-sharing change cluster on `fix/session-sharing-reliability`, including sync-level and org-floor policy, scope matching, endpoint/share-token provenance, cloud replay import, fork and parent navigation, local external-history continuation, comments/`@agent`/Address Comments, Realtime ownership, fork snapshot integrity, and the rendered cloud E2E evidence. Existing focused audits remain authoritative for the adjacent subsystems:

- `docs/architecture-audit-2026-07-18/SharedSessionPolling.md` — Realtime/polling fan-out and request ownership.
- `docs/architecture-audit-2026-07-17/ChatHistory.md` — chat-history rendering/projection.

This is an audit-only report. No production source was changed while writing it.

## Outcome

The branch closes most of the originally reported product gaps, but it is not ready to describe as architecturally complete. The critical paths are now present—explicit cloud level intent reaches the push engine, org-floor mirroring is consumed by sync, cloud forks use an explicit local execution picker, inherited events are retained, fork provenance survives ordinary list reloads through a durable relay registry, comment `@agent` tasks have distinct queued/active states, Address Comments targets the source thread, and custom share links carry endpoint provenance.

The remaining blockers are concentrated at boundaries rather than missing UI:

1. **The local external-history continuation still ignores the selected agent.** The shared setup dialog returns `agentDefinitionId`, but `externalHistoryFork.ts` writes `BUILTIN_SDE_DEF_ID` into `SessionService.create`. Its test was updated to satisfy the new type but never asserts the field sent to production.
2. **Scope-matched imported history plus an admin floor can become an implicit upload grant.** The branch newly admits every scope-matchable imported session into the engine, then `resolveCloudPushAccess` raises `off` to the org floor. A display-only repo match can therefore upload metadata or full replay without a per-session tag/override.
3. **Guest import provenance is not authoritative across restart/list refresh.** `shareToken` and `shareEndpointUrl` are persisted inside the frontend session cache, but `loadSessions()` replaces that cache with backend/adapter rows. Guest cloud imports have no backend row, so the imported parent and its capability can disappear before a later fork or parent navigation.
4. **The explicit-share flow retains the old double-pass composition.** `resumeOrg()` starts a pass; the immediately following `runSyncPassAndWaitForDrain()` calls `runSyncPass()` again, sees the active pass, sets `passDirty`, and schedules another complete pass. The branch added `invalidateOrgInboundAndWait()` precisely to avoid this pattern but did not migrate the share call sites.
5. **Endpoint reset does not clear every backend-coupled marker.** `org2CloudPushedMetadataAtom` is persisted server-history state but is absent from `resetCloudStateForEndpointSwitch`.
6. **Fork validation proves structure and summary agreement, not payload content integrity.** Decoded segment lengths and recomputed hashes are never compared with wire `eventCount`/`segmentHash`; the strict tail check compares one unverified wire hash with another.
7. **Entitlement/floor reads still have more than one coordinator.** Roster bootstrap/refetch hydrates every org without sharing the Realtime coordinator’s per-org single-flight/TTL. The sync engine no longer owns a second entitlement poll, which is correct, but reconnect/bootstrap can still overlap two readers.

## Ten-layer audit

### Layer 1 — compilation correctness

- `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`: **passed**.
- Targeted Vitest: **8 files / 160 tests passed**.
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/crates/agent-core/Cargo.toml`: **passed**; Cargo reported only the existing future-incompatibility notice for dependency `block v0.1.6`.
- `git diff --check`: **passed**.
- Cloud E2E JavaScript `node --check`: **passed** for both specs and the shared driver.
- Full rendered cloud E2E was **not run**: all of `E2E_CLOUD_SUPABASE_URL`, `E2E_CLOUD_ANON_KEY`, `E2E_CLOUD_SERVICE_KEY`, `E2E_CLOUD_EMAIL`, and `E2E_CLOUD_PASSWORD` were absent.

Compilation is green, but it does not detect selected-agent loss, double-pass scheduling, implicit floor admission, or provenance replacement.

### Layer 2 — dead code and structural deduplication

- Duplicate entitlement coordinators remain: roster hydration and Realtime hydration.
- `cloudPublishSeededSessionEvents` is definition/export-only within E2E and has no scenario caller.
- The sync engine is correctly no longer a third entitlement owner.
- Fork/import assembly is shared through `fetchAndAssembleSegments`; do not fork a second codec to add integrity checks.
- The deleted `SessionCore/sync/brick` subtree is orthogonal to this domain and should be reviewed separately rather than treated as cloud cleanup.

### Layer 3 — naming consistency

The primary naming defect is not spelling but implied semantics:

- `runSyncPassAndWaitForDrain` means “request a pass and wait,” not “wait for the active pass.”
- “sync level,” “access mode,” “share level,” and “sharing floor” are related but distinct; UI and code should not abbreviate all of them to “level.”
- `importedFrom` means read-only cursor/capability provenance; `forkedFrom` means writable lineage; `parentSessionId` is local navigation/history ancestry. They must not substitute for one another.
- “current endpoint” and “issuing endpoint” are different concepts and are now correctly named in the share resolver.

### Layer 4 — semantic-overloading table

| floor    | admin minimum for allowed/effective access                  | implicit upload admission in current resolver composition   | Fix: a floor should constrain an admitted session, not silently define admission for external history. |
| share    | publish a session row/events                                | create a directed/link capability grant                     | `prepareReplayShare` correctly separates publish-before-grant, but the wait seam is wrong.             |
| import   | materialize read-only cloud replay                          | list external CLI history from local adapters               | Different authorities and restart behavior; loader merge policy must encode both.                      |
| parent   | source cloud session (`forkedFrom`)                         | local `parentSessionId` used by normal history continuation | Parent navigation must resolve through the provenance appropriate to the source.                       |
| endpoint | globally active cloud deployment                            | immutable deployment that issued a share token              | Current-run resolver is correct; durability is incomplete.                                             |
| agent    | source session’s display/definition hint                    | local runnable definition selected for continuation         | Source is hint only; selected local id must be the persisted authority.                                |

### Layer 5 — default-branch analysis

| Default / fallback                                                       | Verdict                      | Reason                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentDefinitionId: BUILTIN_SDE_DEF_ID` in external-history continuation | unsafe                       | Overrides explicit user choice and future agent variants.                                                        |
| unknown local sharing floor → `off`                                      | keep                         | Privacy-safe locally; server remains authoritative.                                                              |
| floor raises `off` for scope-only imported history                       | unsafe composition           | Safe mode fallback becomes unsafe admission when candidate and grant are conflated.                              |
| missing persisted share endpoint → current endpoint                      | keep only for legacy records | New links carry endpoint provenance. A missing field on a new record should be observable in tests, not routine. |
| custom share endpoint mismatch → fail closed                             | keep                         | Prevents silent credential/endpoint mutation and wrong-backend reads.                                            |
| fork snapshot mismatch → typed `snapshot_incomplete`                     | keep                         | Correct fail-closed behavior.                                                                                    |
| session list refresh → replace all frontend rows                         | unsafe generic default       | Erases valid frontend-only session categories/provenance.                                                        |

### Layer 6 — cross-domain leakage

- The managed-cloud-specific wire client stays in `Org2Cloud`; backend-agnostic import/fork assembly stays in `TeamCollaboration`. Keep this boundary.
- Explicit local agent selection belongs in fork setup and backend session registration, not in cloud metadata. Current cloud fork follows that rule; external-history continuation does not.
- Share-token endpoint capability should not leak into generic `forkedFrom` UI provenance. Use a dedicated capability registry/resolver.
- Logger runtime detection, Rust prompt sections and Brick history synchronization do not belong in the session-sharing change cluster.

### Layer 7 — new-developer confusion test

A new developer reading the current code would reasonably make three incorrect assumptions:

1. `resetCloudStateForEndpointSwitch` clears **all** backend state because its doc says so; it does not clear `org2CloudPushedMetadataAtom`.
2. `runSyncPassAndWaitForDrain` can safely follow `resumeOrg`; it actually marks the active pass dirty.
3. Persisting `shareEndpointUrl` in `Session.importedFrom` makes it restart-safe; `loadSessions()` later replaces that row.

These are architecture defects because comments and names point to stronger guarantees than execution provides.

### Layer 8 — wire protocol and serialization

- Share links carry only token + non-secret endpoint provenance; custom endpoint imports require locally configured publishable coordinates. Keep.
- Resolve and segment fetch use one endpoint snapshot, preventing mid-flow endpoint switching. Keep.
- Fork summary reconciliation checks epoch/frozen seq/count/tail hash against the list row. Keep.
- Segment payload bytes are gzip-decoded, but decoded content is not verified against `eventCount`/`segmentHash`. Fix.
- `agentDefinitionId` is not a cloud wire field; it is correctly persisted to the local backend session record. The external-history entry point must follow the same boundary.

### Layer 9 — entry-point parity matrix

| Entry point                                  |                            Workspace picker | Explicit local agent |                    Account/model |      Authoritative backend row |             Source replay integrity |    Restart-safe source capability |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------: | -------------------: | -------------------------------: | -----------------------------: | ----------------------------------: | --------------------------------: |
| Cloud remote row → fork                      |                                         yes |                  yes |                              yes |                            yes |                   summary/structure | membership JWT; yes after re-auth |
| Imported member replay header → fork         |                                         yes |                  yes |                              yes |                            yes |                   summary/structure |               org membership; yes |
| Guest share import → later fork              |              import workspace + fork picker |                  yes |                              yes | fork: yes; imported parent: no |                   summary/structure |    **no after full list replace** |
| Imported replay composer send → fork         |                                         yes |                  yes |                              yes |                            yes |                   summary/structure |         same gap for guest parent |
| Local Codex/Claude/Cursor history → continue |                                         yes |   **picker ignored** |                              yes |    created by `SessionService` | bounded handoff, not segment replay |              local adapter source |
| Comment-task/Address Comments fork           | explicit runner settings/headless execution |             explicit | explicit/default runner settings |                            yes |                    shared fork path |                    membership JWT |

Parity fails on the selected agent for local external history and on guest capability durability.

### Layer 10 — resolver symmetry

#### Execution selection fallback matrix

| Field            |             Source hint | User selection |               Local validation |           Persisted authority |
| ---------------- | ----------------------: | -------------: | -----------------------------: | ----------------------------: |
| workspace        |    repo scope/path hint |            yes |                scope-key match |           backend `repo_path` |
| agent definition |    display/id hint only |            yes |      local definition registry | backend `agent_definition_id` |
| account          | none/source not trusted |            yes |          local key/account set |          backend `account_id` |
| model            |  source preference hint |            yes | runnable with selected account |               backend `model` |

Cloud forks implement this matrix. `externalHistoryFork.ts` breaks symmetry only for agent definition by replacing the selected value after validation.

#### Guest provenance fallback matrix

| Field            | In-memory imported row | session localStorage |            authoritative list refresh | fork relay / dedicated registry |        parent navigation |
| ---------------- | ---------------------: | -------------------: | ------------------------------------: | ------------------------------: | -----------------------: |
| org/source ids   |                    yes |                  yes |                     no guaranteed row |               fork lineage only |        current run works |
| share token      |                    yes |                  yes |                                  lost |        absent from fork lineage |  fails after parent loss |
| issuing endpoint |                    yes |                  yes |                                  lost |        absent from fork lineage |  fails after parent loss |
| imported events  |             EventStore |     EventStore/cache | events may survive but row can vanish |    no parent capability mapping | orphaned replay possible |

The fallback chain is asymmetric: events and fork lineage can survive while the capability required to re-open/re-fork the source does not.

## Acceptance criteria before merge

- [ ] A non-default agent selected in every continuation/fork entry point is the exact `agent_definition_id` persisted in the created session.
- [ ] Scope match alone never uploads local external history unless the product explicitly defines and communicates a mandatory admin-upload policy.
- [ ] `resumeOrg`/explicit-share preparation causes one serialized pass, not a guaranteed dirty follow-up.
- [ ] Endpoint switch clears or namespaces every backend-derived cursor, marker, policy mirror and runner setting.
- [ ] Guest imported replay, token, issuing endpoint and parent navigation survive cold restart plus forced `loadSessions()` refresh.
- [ ] Every decoded segment verifies count and content hash before fork/import assembly.
- [ ] Entitlement reads use one per-store/per-org coordinator and one shared TTL/single-flight rule.
- [ ] Rendered E2E selects a non-default agent and inspects persisted authority.
- [ ] Rendered E2E includes restart/refresh coverage for guest import → fork → parent navigation.
- [ ] Live dual-instance E2E is run with valid credentials; skip output, syntax checks and unit tests are not reported as rendered success.
- [ ] Orthogonal logger/prompt/Brick changes are split or explicitly reviewed as separate deliverables.

3. Replace the explicit-share double-pass composition with one wait-aware invalidation.
4. Add endpoint-state reset/namespace coverage.
5. Introduce durable guest capability ownership and restart-safe parent resolution.
6. Add segment hash/count verification.
7. Centralize entitlement hydration.
