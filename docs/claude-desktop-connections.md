# Claude Desktop connections

For saved providers, custom model IDs, and role mappings, see [Claude provider profiles](claude-provider-profiles.md).

Open **Settings → App connections → Claude Desktop**. Claude Code CLI and Codex have separate selectors and independent applied connections. The existing `app/harness-connections` settings URL is unchanged.

Desktop is configured only through saved provider profiles. Create a profile, or
choose **Copy current connection** to start from the connection currently applied
to Desktop (it does not read the CLI's connection). Select the profile's Key Vault
credential, endpoint, and authentication scheme, then configure the model roles.
Save the profile, test its models, and apply it. Fully quit and reopen Claude
Desktop after applying or restoring. Endpoint and mapping changes belong to this
app's profile and do not edit the shared credential or CLI configuration.

## Compatibility

Saved profiles support custom model IDs through native Desktop family-tier
mapping. There is no single-model quick editor for Desktop; that editor remains
for Claude Code CLI and Codex only. Model availability depends on the endpoint.

The native adapter targets Claude Desktop 1.46388.1 and newer within the 1.x line on macOS and Windows; a different major version is reported as an unverified configuration format instead of being written. Pre-release suffixes such as `1.46388.1-beta` are compared by their numeric segments. The local macOS installation inspected during development was 1.46388.4. Version detection supports `/Applications/Claude.app`, user Applications installs, and on Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\claude.exe` (Squirrel layout) with `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude\Claude.exe` as a fallback. The Windows paths follow Anthropic's documentation but have not been exercised on a Windows machine. Linux is explicitly unsupported by this adapter, even though newer upstream Desktop versions document Linux configuration.

Native Desktop UI/runtime behavior, including separate Chat/Cowork/Code sessions, has not been exercised. A protocol test or generated profile does not establish native-app runtime compatibility. This change neither launches nor restarts Desktop automatically.

Protocol translation and the broader Codex/ORGII model catalog expansion remain separate work. Desktop profiles use native direct routing, without an ORGII proxy.

## Configuration ownership and recovery

The adapter writes four user-owned files: normal Desktop configuration, 3P Desktop configuration, the profile catalog, and a distinct ORGII profile. On macOS these live under `~/Library/Application Support/Claude` and `Claude-3p`. On Windows the normal Desktop configuration is the roaming `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Electron `userData`), while the 3P configuration, catalog, and profile live under the local `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p`. An isolated `ORGII_EXTERNAL_HISTORY_HOME` redirects all these paths.

Only the deployment-mode selector is changed in each app config. Other fields and catalog entries are preserved. ORGII does not change network-egress permissions or suppress the native mode chooser. Existing inline enterprise configuration and detected managed preferences/policy block local switching. This check is conservative: even an app-behavior-only managed policy is currently reported as externally controlled.

All four files participate in the existing locked, journaled config transaction. The adapter refuses stale previews, existing unowned profile-ID collisions, malformed configuration, and conflicting external edits. **Restore original setup** restores the exact pre-switch files, including the previous mode/profile selection, and removes files that were originally absent. It does not necessarily select official login if the prior setup was already third-party. Native account credentials are not changed.

Direct configuration continues to work after ORGII exits. A vault key deletion or rotation does not revoke/rewrite credentials already exported to Desktop: test and reapply the updated key, or restore the original configuration. Restore Desktop before downgrading ORGII to a release that lacks this adapter. There is no database migration; the existing manifest format and CLI target identities are preserved.

The Windows-only `winreg` dependency reads policy without launching a subprocess; its version was already in the lockfile. Windows installation version lookup uses a bounded, cancellable PowerShell read of executable metadata with its console window suppressed, and never runs Claude.
