//! Per-call framework metadata threaded explicitly to every `Tool::execute`.
//!
//! `CallContext` replaces the previous mechanism of injecting `__call_id`
//! and `__session_id` into the params `Value` itself
//! (`turn_executor::tool_execution::inject_framework_meta` + boundary
//! stripping in `parse_params` / MCP bridge). That mechanism was a
//! data + metadata polyglot — every new consumer path had to remember to
//! strip the reserved namespace, and we shipped two real bugs after
//! adding `__session_id` (strict agent-org task tools rejecting every
//! call; `__session_id` leaking to external MCP servers).
//!
//! Threading a typed context makes the contract compiler-enforced and
//! gives a single, obvious place to add future framework keys (e.g.,
//! `turn_index`, `parent_call_id`) without touching the params pipeline.
//!
//! ## Semantics
//!
//! - `call_id`: identifies one tool invocation within a turn. Sourced
//!   from `ToolUse.id` (Anthropic) or the synthesized id for OpenAI-
//!   compatible streaming. Used by the MCP bridge to stamp
//!   `agent:mcp_progress` events and by orchestration tools that need
//!   per-call correlation.
//!
//! - `session_id`: the *dispatching* session's id. Per-call attribution
//!   is race-free even when background subagents (which inherit the
//!   parent's `ToolRegistry`) run concurrently — unlike the legacy
//!   `ToolRegistry::set_session_key` shared mutable state that was the
//!   root cause of the `create_plan` subagent-misattribution saga.
//!
//! - `turn_intent_id` and `projected_inbox_ids`: identify the exact durable
//!   turn and Inbox batch whose effects become committed only after this turn
//!   succeeds. Agent Org Quiescence uses them to build a prospective
//!   completion certificate without guessing or subtracting unrelated work.
//!
//! ## Defaults
//!
//! `CallContext::default()` is a zero-value context (empty strings).
//! Test fixtures and direct in-process callers that don't have a real
//! dispatching session use `&CallContext::default()`; production
//! dispatch always constructs a populated ctx in
//! `turn_executor::tool_execution`.
