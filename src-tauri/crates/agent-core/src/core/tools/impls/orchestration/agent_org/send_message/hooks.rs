//! Fire-and-forget hooks used by `org_send_message`: waking idle
//! recipients after an inbox insert (`InboxWakeHook`), and self-aborting
//! the sender's own turn after an accepted shutdown handshake
//! (`SelfAbortHook`). No-op implementations are provided for tests and
//! for org sessions without a runtime `AppState`.

/// Hook the tool calls (fire-and-forget) once an inbox row has been
/// persisted, so that idle or stopped recipient sessions can be woken
/// up to drain their inbox on a fresh background turn.
///
/// The hook receives `(recipient_member_id, org_run_id)` and is expected to:
/// 1. Resolve the recipient member_id to a session_id within the org run.
/// 2. Skip statuses that must not start a second/background turn: running,
///    pending, paused, waiting-for-user, waiting-for-funds, and archived.
/// 3. Otherwise spawn a fresh turn (e.g. via `send_message_impl` with
///    empty content) so the inbox-drain hook on the turn boundary fires.
///
/// The tool itself never blocks on the wake — failures and skips are
/// logged at the hook implementation. The persisted inbox row is the
/// source of truth; if the wake never happens, the row is still drained
/// the next time the recipient session takes a turn.
