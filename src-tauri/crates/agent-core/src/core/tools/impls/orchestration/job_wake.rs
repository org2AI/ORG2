//! `JobCompletionWakeHook` trait + process-wide `OnceLock` install slot.
//!
//! # Problem this solves
//!
//! When a session launches a **background** job — a subagent worker or a
//! backgrounded shell process — and its own turn ends before the job does,
//! the job finishes with no active turn to surface its result. Until the
//! owner takes another turn, the completed job's output sits unread — and
//! the registry grace period can delete it first. The result: the owner
//! never learns the job finished and silently does not continue. For shells
//! this used to be a hard protocol gap: the model's only alternative was to
//! poll `await_output` every 30s, which the turn executor's repeat guard
//! could misread as an infinite loop.
//!
//! # How the wake works
//!
//! This mirrors Claude Code's `task-notification` → idle-queue-processor
//! design (`tasks/LocalAgentTask.tsx` enqueues a notification; `useQueueProcessor`
//! auto-starts a turn when the parent loop is idle). ORGII already has the
//! equivalent restart primitive in `send_message_impl_for_job_wake(session_id)`
//! (a sibling of the Agent Org `InboxWakeHook`'s `send_message_impl_for_org_wake`).
//! This hook lets the job completion paths reach it without `background.rs` /
//! `subprocess.rs` (which live below the Tauri layer) needing an `AppHandle`.
//!
//! # Single coordinator, two triggers, exactly-once
//!
//! Two triggers can observe a completed background job:
//!   1. the completion push from the job's own monitor task (`background.rs`
//!      for subagents, `subprocess.rs` for shells — fires the moment the job
//!      terminates), and
//!   2. the turn-end re-check in `lifecycle::finalize_session` (fires when the
//!      owner's own turn ends, covering the case where the job finished
//!      while the owner was still mid-turn).
//!
//! Both call the SAME coordinator (`wake_owner` → `wake_owner_session`),
//! which owns the entire decision. It does not carry per-trigger gates; instead
//! it atomically *claims* the result via
//! `registry::claim_completion_wake_for_session` (which marks the job
//! `wake_dispatched` in the same locked pass). Whichever trigger claims first
//! delivers it; the other sees nothing. This makes "a result wakes the owner
//! at most once" an invariant of the registry rather than of caller ordering,
//! and removes the earlier ad-hoc retry-storm / empty-wake guards.
//!
//! The production implementation (installed at app boot in `lib.rs`) resolves
//! the owner session's status after claiming: if the owner is idle/terminal
//! it dispatches a resume turn; if it is still running it RELEASES the claim
//! (so the turn-end re-check can re-claim once the owner goes idle), because a
//! running owner will otherwise pick the result up via its current turn's
//! Background Jobs reminder. The status gate is `should_wake_owner`.
