//! Named entry points that adapt callers onto [`send_message_impl`].
//!
//! [`send_message_impl`] takes a wide argument list because it is the single
//! turn-submission path for every source (composer submit, plan-approval
//! re-entry, mobile remote, background wakes). The wrappers here pin the
//! argument combination each non-composer caller needs, so the wake hooks and
//! debug routes cannot drift from the contract by passing the wrong flag.

/// and NO new chat round is created. The owner continues inside the same
/// round it was already in.
///
/// A plain SDE session has no inbox to drain, so unlike the Agent Org path
/// nothing converts to a trailing user message on its own. That would leave
/// the conversation ending on the owner's last *assistant* message
/// ("已在后台启动。"), which providers reject with `HTTP 400: ... conversation
/// must end with a user message`. The unified processor closes that gap: on a
/// resume whose assembled message list still ends with an assistant turn, it
/// appends a **transient** (in-memory only, never persisted) user nudge so the
/// prefill invariant holds — see `inject_job_wake_nudge_if_needed` in
/// `turn/processor/mod.rs`. The actual job result still arrives via the
/// background-jobs system reminder.
