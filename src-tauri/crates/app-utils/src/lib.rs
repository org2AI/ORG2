//! Small utility helpers shared across workspace crates.
//!
//! JSON file I/O (`json::*`) used by CLI agent config modules, Serde
//! defaults, and opt-in test fixtures. No workspace-crate dependencies.
//!
//! Add new general-purpose helpers here when two or more workspace crates
//! would otherwise duplicate them. If a helper is specific to one domain
//! (key vault, settings, etc.), keep it inside that crate instead.
