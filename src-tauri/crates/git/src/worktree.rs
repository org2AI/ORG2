//! Git worktree manager for parallel coding agent sessions.
//!
//! Each coding session that requests isolation gets its own git worktree on a
//! dedicated branch. This prevents concurrent sessions from conflicting on the
//! same working directory. Worktrees live under `~/.orgii/agent-worktrees/`.
//!
//! The hash-naming pattern keeps each worktree dir unique per repo path.
//!
//! The implementation is split across the submodules below; this file is the
//! facade that keeps every `crate::worktree::*` / `git::worktree::*` path
//! resolving as before.
