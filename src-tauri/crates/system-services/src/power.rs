//! System power management — "prevent system sleep" while agent sessions run.
//!
//! Exposes two Tauri commands:
//! - `system_power_acquire_sleep_inhibitor` — keep system awake (per-window, refcounted)
//! - `system_power_release_sleep_inhibitor` — allow normal sleep (per-window, refcounted)
//!
//! The frontend calls acquire/release in response to:
//! (a) the `general.preventSleepWhileRunning` setting toggling, and
//! (b) the count of actively-working sessions transitioning between 0 and >0.
//!
//! Multi-window semantics: every OS window (the main window plus detached
//! `app-window-session-<id>` windows) runs its own copy of the frontend hook
//! and calls these commands independently, but the OS assertion is
//! process-wide. The state is therefore a holder SET keyed by window label
//! backing a single platform handle: a window's acquire registers its label
//! and the platform assertion is created only for the first holder; a
//! window's release removes only its own label and the assertion is dropped
//! only when the last holder leaves. This prevents one window's release
//! (e.g. a detached session window closing or its session going idle first)
//! from tearing the assertion out from under another window that still
//! needs it.
//!
//! Leak protection: a window can be destroyed without its JS cleanup ever
//! running. The `WindowEvent::Destroyed` handler in `lib.rs` calls
//! [`release_sleep_inhibitor_for_window_label`] so a dead window's holder
//! entry cannot pin the assertion until process exit.
//!
//! Platform implementations:
//! - macOS:   `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` (`kIOPMAssertPreventUserIdleSystemSleep`).
//!   Releasing the assertion ID is what lets the system sleep again.
//! - Windows: `SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS | ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)`.
//!   Release clears with `ES_CONTINUOUS` alone.
//! - Linux:   No-op for now (D-Bus `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.Inhibit` can
//!   be added later if there's user demand).
