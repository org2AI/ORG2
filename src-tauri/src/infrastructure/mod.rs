//! Cross-cutting in-tree infrastructure that is too small or too tightly
//! coupled to `app::run()` to live in its own workspace crate. Hot leaf
//! pieces (perf, transport, file_ops, window, platform commands) have
//! all been hoisted to dedicated workspace crates and are referenced
//! through their bare crate names — no `infrastructure::*` re-export
//! shims.

// Per-install cloud device identity for member-runtime sharing
// (~/.orgii/cloud_device_id — deliberately separate from the diagnostics
// install_id so shared runtime rows stay unlinkable from telemetry).

// themselves live in the `app_paths` workspace crate; this module just
// composes them into the Settings → Disk Usage report.
