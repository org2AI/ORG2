/**
 * Project store Tauri client.

 * Thin `invoke()` wrappers for the `project_*` commands. All calls
 * are slug-keyed — the old `repoPath` boundary is gone, and projects
 * are listed from the global store.
 *
 * Split by command family; `scope.ts` holds the shared `orgId` helpers and is
 * intentionally not re-exported (internal to the client).
