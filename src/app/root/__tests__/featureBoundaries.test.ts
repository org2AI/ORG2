/**
 * Heavy-feature boundary guards for lazily loaded surfaces.
 *
 * Each root below is its own async chunk (a route page, workstation app,
 * or event renderer). Before this guard existed, several of them statically
 * reached the editor/terminal/highlighter/chart stacks through barrel
 * re-exports (`modules/WorkStation/shared`, `features/CodeMirror`) or a
 * single eager import — e.g. the agent-message renderer (every chat) pulled
 * xterm, CodeMirror, react-syntax-highlighter, highlight.js, recharts,
 * mammoth and jszip. See docs/memory-audit-2026-08-16 (Fix log).
 *
 * If a surface genuinely needs one of these packages, load it behind a
 * `React.lazy` / dynamic `import()` at the point of use, or move the root
 * to the allow-list below with a reason.
