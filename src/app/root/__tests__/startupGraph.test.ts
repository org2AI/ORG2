 * Startup-graph guards.

 * Everything statically reachable from `src/index.tsx` and `src/App.tsx` is
 * parsed and evaluated before first paint (index.tsx synchronously, App.tsx
 * as the first async chunk). These tests pin the boundaries recovered in
 * docs/memory-audit-2026-08-16/ram-optimization-findings.md so a future
 * barrel re-export or "convenience" import cannot silently drag a heavy
 * library back into boot. If a package below genuinely becomes a boot-time
 * dependency, move it to the allow-list with a reason.
