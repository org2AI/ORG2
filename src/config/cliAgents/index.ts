 * `src-tauri/src/agent_sessions/cli/session_runner/session.rs`. Every other
 * CLI agent runs as a headless shell-out (one piped subprocess per turn,
 * stream-json/stdout parsing).
 *
 * Note: distinct from the registry's `acpSupport` capability metadata — that
 * describes what the CLI itself supports; this set reflects the transport
 * ORGII's GUI actually uses today.
