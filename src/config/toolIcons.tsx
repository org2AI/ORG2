/**
 * Icon rendering for agent tools and events.
 *
 * **Authoritative icon ids** for built-in tools come from Rust `ToolInfo.icon_id`
 * (`list_all_tools`). `ICON_BY_ID` maps those kebab-case ids to hugeicons
 * glyph data. `mcp-logo` maps to the vendor's `McpServerIcon`, which draws
 * the actual MCP logo mark; other brand marks are hand-authored SVG
 * components handled outside this registry.
 *
 * NOTE: Terminal tool detection uses normalizeFunctionName() (Rust source of truth
 * via cli_agents/alias_map.rs) instead of hardcoded tool names.
