/**
 * Browser webview mount window policy.
 *
 * Only the active browser session plus the `MAX_WARM_INACTIVE_WEBVIEWS` most
 * recently active ones keep their `BrowserSessionWebview` mounted. Everything
 * else unmounts, which is what actually destroys the native webview:
 * `useInlineWebview` calls `destroy()` from its unmount cleanup only, so a
 * session that merely goes inactive is not released — it is parked offscreen
 * at `(-10000, -10000)`, keeping its size, and keeps running (see
 * `useWebviewLayout`'s `parkOffscreen`). A parked webview is a full live page:
 * its own WebContent process on macOS, holding page JS, timers, and media.
 *
 * `recentIdWindow.ts` already named browser-tab webviews as an intended
 * consumer; until this module, the terminal pane window was its only caller.
 *
 * A window rather than a blanket unmount-on-deactivate, because the tradeoff
 * differs from terminals. A terminal remounts losslessly from Rust
 * (`attach_pty_stream` snapshot plus the serialized client buffer). A webview
 * has no such restore: unmounting drops in-page state — scroll position, form
 * input, media playback — and the tab reloads from `session.url` on return.
 * Keeping a few recent tabs warm preserves that for the ones a user actually
 * flips between, which is the same tradeoff a browser makes when it discards
 * background tabs.
 *
 * The warm count is smaller than the terminal window's because a WKWebView is
 * far more expensive than an xterm instance.
