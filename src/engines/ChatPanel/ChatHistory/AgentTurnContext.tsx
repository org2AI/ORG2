/**
 * AgentTurnContext
 *
 * Per-group context that exposes turn-scoped actions (regenerate, etc.)
 * to the activity event renderer tree below `ChatItemRenderer`.
 *
 * Why context and not prop drill:
 *   - Registry-based lazy components (`getChatLazyComponent`) only accept
 *     `event` + `itemIndex`. Threading extra props through the registry
 *     would pollute the generic event-component contract.
 *   - "Regenerate" is a per-turn action, scoped to one group. The sticky
 *     header of that group (the user message) already lives in
 *     `ChatHistory`; context is the cleanest way to bind the turn-level
 *     callback to its descendants without widening every renderer signature.
 *   - Same shape can host future per-turn actions without repeated prop-drill
 *     work.
 *
 * Consumer rules:
 *   - Turn actions must rely on explicit context fields rather than infer
 *     state from the surrounding renderer tree.
