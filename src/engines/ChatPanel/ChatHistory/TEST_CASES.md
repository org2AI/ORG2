# Test Cases: ChatHistory

## Preconditions

- Session is loaded with a non-empty event array.
- `ChatHistory` is rendered inside `ChatSessionContext`, Jotai provider, and i18n context.
- `GroupedVirtuoso` scroll container is mounted in a layout with measurable height.
- Pagination feature flag and `useChatPagination` hook are initialized.

| 1   | Disable pagination; open several turns.                                                                                                          | User messages render as right-aligned bubbles in chronological flow; scrolling does not pin or duplicate a turn header.                                             |

| 13  | Open an Agent Org Member history whose Task event was `in_progress` but whose current durable Task is cancelled, failed, completed, or replaced. | The immutable event-time status remains visible and a Run-scoped current-state overlay shows the authoritative status, owner, generation, and replacement identity. |

| 19  | GitHub feature branch with open PR   | Open a focused chat for a Git repo whose current branch has an open PR.                                   | The Environment rail shows Compare branch plus the exact branch PR and its passed, running, failed, empty, or unavailable CI status. |
| 20  | Narrow left-docked chat pane         | Narrow the chat pane below 640px and hover a minimap handle.                                              | The preview opens to the handle's right; wide panes and right-docked chats continue opening it to the left.                          |
| 21  | Current Task projection is missing   | Open a historical Agent Org Task card whose Task id is absent from the matching Run's bounded projection. | The card says the current record is unavailable; it does not present the historical status as current.                               |
| 22  | Many visible historical Task cards   | Render 100 Task cards from one Agent Org Run.                                                             | They consume the one shared Run View projection and add no per-card query, polling timer, or subscription.                           |

| 1   | Session atom rejects         | Session atom throws.                                      | Error boundary catches; fallback UI shown.                |
| 2   | Item renderer throws         | A single `ChatItemRenderer` throws for a malformed event. | Error boundary catches per-item; rest of history renders. |
| 3   | Scroll container zero height | `GroupedVirtuoso` mounted in 0-height container.          | No infinite loop; renders gracefully.                     |

## Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard-navigable (Tab through turns; Enter to expand/collapse)
- [ ] Screen reader label on list container (announced as "Chat history")
- [ ] Pagination-mode pinned headers do not duplicate focusable controls
- [ ] User bubbles preserve keyboard access to raw-prompt/edit/restore controls in both pagination modes
- [ ] Todo pill exposes its expanded state and closes with Escape or an outside click
- [ ] Conversation minimap markers are keyboard-focusable, expose the selected turn with `aria-current`, and show previews on focus
- [ ] Fenced-code Copy buttons remain keyboard-focusable and have localized accessible labels
- [ ] Compare branch and linked-PR rows expose external-link actions; the collapsed PR icon includes its CI state in the accessible name
- [ ] Focus trap not applicable (scrollable list, not a modal)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All turns render in correct chronological order
- [ ] Non-pagination mode uses natural scrolling without pinned turn headers
- [ ] User messages are compact right-aligned bubbles in both pagination modes
- [ ] Todo progress appears once in the composer row and not inside chat-history groups
- [ ] Non-pagination conversations expose a percentage-sampled minimap with no more than 20 markers
- [ ] Auto-scroll follows agent when user is at bottom
- [ ] Collapse-all collapses all tool-call blocks
- [ ] Pagination controls navigate between pages correctly
- [ ] Search highlights matching turns
- [ ] Empty session shows empty state
- [ ] Duplicate events are deduplicated by the pipeline
- [ ] Completed and unloaded rounds do not add message-level timestamp or Copy footer chrome
- [ ] GitHub feature branches expose Compare branch; only an open PR matching the exact current branch exposes CI status
- [ ] Agent Org Task history keeps event-time state immutable while showing a Run-id + Task-id keyed current-state overlay
- [ ] Missing current Task state fails closed as unavailable and does not create per-card background work
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes with no new failures
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`pnpm typecheck`)

# Agent Org completion blocker recovery ownership

- A normal active member, turn, task, or deliverable Inbox blocker is labelled `waiting_for_runtime`; it is not presented as an active system repair.
- Only a durable active recovery reservation is labelled `system_repairing`.
- A historical unread Coordinator formal task message with no durable task binding is labelled `coordinator_repair_available`, includes its Inbox id and recipient name, and never displays message content.
- Corrupt or otherwise unrepairable blocker data is labelled `system_attention_required`.
- Plan approval or another real product decision is labelled `user_action_required`.
- An unknown future recovery-state value falls back visibly to “System attention is required”.
- Mixed Inbox blockers render as separate rows and use kind + recovery state + reason as their stable React key.
