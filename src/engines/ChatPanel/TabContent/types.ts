/**
 * Chat Panel tab content registry types.
 *
 * Mirrors the WorkStation `TabContent` registry (`src/modules/WorkStation/
 * TabContent/`): a single, exhaustive map from `ChatPanelTabType` to how that
 * tab's content is rendered. Session and Launchpad render in the shared "chat
 * column"; Kanban and terminals get their own keep-alive layers; every other
 * surface renders a dedicated, self-sufficient component that reads its tab
 * payload. An unrecognized type resolves to an explicit placeholder instead of
 * silently falling back to the Launchpad.
