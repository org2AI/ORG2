/**
 * AgentStatusTrail
 *
 * The line that closes the conversation. It is always there once a session
 * has a turn, in one of two readings:
 *
 *   ◼  Agent working for 1h 20m 26s · Agent is typing...
 *   ◼  Waiting for your reply
 *   ◼  Agent is idle                   (a session ORGII runs)
 *   ◼  Last refreshed 5 minutes ago    (an imported transcript)
 *
 * The trailing phrase is what used to be `PlanningFooter`'s own row directly
 * above this one. Two stacked lines saying related things about one running
 * round read as clutter, so the phrase became this line's second segment and
 * the transcript now ends with exactly one live row.
 *
 * Live context usage is deliberately NOT here — the composer's context pill
 * already carries it, and this line answers "is it still going, and for how
 * long".
 *
 * It sits at the very end of the transcript, below the planning line, and is
 * deliberately NOT part of any turn's collapsible body — a turn folds away,
 * this does not, so the readout stays put while the agent works and the mark
 * stays put once it stops.
 *
 * The leading glyph is the session's own harness mark, rendered through
 * `SessionIdentityIcon` — the same projection behind the sidebar row, the
 * chat-panel tab, and the spotlight hit, so a Codex session shows the Codex
 * mark, an imported Cursor session shows Cursor's, and ORGII's native agent
 * shows the ORG2 logo. It breathes on a slow pulse while a round runs — no
 * spinner competing with the tool blocks above — and rests, dimmed and
 * still, otherwise. That contrast is what carries the state, so the phases
 * are never confusable at a glance.
 *
 * Which phase applies is the SESSION's status, resolved by the same rules
 * the sidebar dot uses (see `resolveTrailPhase`), so the mark at the end of
 * the transcript and the dot in the sidebar can never disagree.
 *
 * Data comes from `useAgentStatusTrail`; a segment is dropped rather than
 * shown as a zero or an unknown, so a round whose start is not known degrades
 * to a bare `Agent working`.
