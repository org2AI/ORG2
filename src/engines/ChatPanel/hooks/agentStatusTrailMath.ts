 * `streamingHudMath.ts`, so the duration formatting and the activity
 * precedence rules can be unit-tested without a store or a renderer.

 * states the sidebar's session dot has — see `resolveTrailPhase`.
 *
 * - `"hidden"` — no row at all: no session, or a surface that must not carry
 *   a live readout (a paginated page that is not the final round).
 * - `"idle"` — the agent mark at rest with a short label. The transcript
 *   always ends with the agent's own glyph, so the panel reads as "here, and
 *   waiting" rather than simply stopping.
 * - `"asking"` — the round is parked on a question for the viewer.
 * - `"running"` — the full readout, mark pulsing.

 * `agent:complete` — the case `usePlanningIndicator`'s watchdog exists for.
 * Either way the trail would sit there pulsing "Running tools... 3h 20m"

 * wins over it — a question that has been open for an hour is still open.
 *

 * check MUST come first or a session parked on a question would read as
 * actively working — the same trap the sidebar's `&& !pendingAsking` guard
 * exists to avoid. Keeping the order here, in one pure function, is what
 * stops the trail and the sidebar from ever describing a session two
 * different ways.
 *
 * The sidebar's fourth tone, `unread`, has no meaning here: it marks a
 * finished session the viewer has not opened, and the trail only ever renders
