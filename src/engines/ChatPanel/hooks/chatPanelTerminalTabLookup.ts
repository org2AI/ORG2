/**
 * chatPanelTerminalTabLookup
 *
 * Pure lookup extracted from `useChatPanelTabsController` so the "is this
 * CLI launch already open in a terminal tab?" decision is unit-testable
 * without pulling in Jotai atoms or React.
 *
 * A chat-panel terminal tab (`ChatPanelTab`, keyed by `terminalSessionId`)
 * and the PTY session it drives (`TerminalSession`, in the shared terminal
 * atom store) are two different records. The backend mints a brand-new
 * managed `code_sessions` row (and therefore a new `agentSessionId`) on
 * every `cli_agent_create` call, so a repeat "Continue in <CLI>" click
 * can't be recognized by comparing session ids. What *is* stable across
 * repeat clicks for the same resume target is the fully-resolved command
 * line — for an imported-session resume it already carries the
 * resume-specific args (`--resume <uuid>`, `--session <path>`, …), and for
 * a fresh CLI TUI launch it's the resolved launch-profile command. Two
 * launches with the same agent, the same resolved command, and the same
 * cwd are the same target.
