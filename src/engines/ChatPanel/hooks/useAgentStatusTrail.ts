/**
 * useAgentStatusTrail
 *
 * Assembles the status trail that closes the conversation: while a round runs,
 * how long it has been going; between rounds, a resting phase so the
 * transcript still ends with the agent's own mark instead of simply stopping,
 * plus any background work that outlived the round.
 *
 * It is a derived view only — it owns no canonical state and is safe to
 * mount and unmount freely. Every input already exists:
 *
 *   - phase    — the SESSION's own status, read through the same helpers the
 *     sidebar row uses (`isSessionInProgress`, `isSessionPendingAsking`) and
 *     combined in the same order (`resolveTrailPhase`). Liveness itself goes
 *     through `resolveTailTurnAgentWorking`, so the trail, the tail-turn
 *     collapse phase, and the sidebar dot all read one rule: the foreground
 *     runtime atom for a native session, the persisted status for an
 *     external-history one.
 *   - elapsed  — anchored to the tail turn's start (`ChatGroupMeta.startMs`),
 *     the same instant `TurnCollapsePinBar` measures from once the round
 *     ends, so the live trail and the finished "Agent worked for X" bar
 *     always agree. Anchoring to a real event timestamp (rather than to when
 *     this hook happened to mount) keeps the count correct across session
 *     switches, remounts, and virtualization. Only the anchor is returned:
 *     `AgentStatusTrail` runs the per-second clock itself, so the ticking
 *     value never travels through `ChatHistoryList`'s memoized props.
 *   - tasks    — the same running shell processes and subagent workers that
 *     `ActiveProcesses` lists in the composer.
 *   - refresh  — for an imported transcript, `DataSourceConfig.lastScannedAt`
 *     for that session's source: the same timestamp the Runtime scanning
 *     panel shows, written by every importer run and by the sidebar's
 *     Rescan. ORGII does not run those agents, so it reports when it last
 *     looked rather than asserting they are idle.
 *
 * The pure formatting and precedence rules live in `agentStatusTrailMath.ts`.
