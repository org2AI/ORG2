/**
 * "Drop a session into this channel" — the channel-surface half of the drag
 * protocol the Team Inbox and the chat composer already speak.
 *
 * The whole panel (transcript + composer footer) is one drop target, and a
 * dropped session becomes a REAL pill in the composer via
 * `ComposerInputRef.insertFilePill` — the same call `useAtMention` makes for
 * an `@`-picked session — so the post carries `[session:<id>]` and renders as
 * a clickable pill instead of pasted text.
 *
 * One overlap has to be resolved: `InputArea` already owns a drop target of
 * its own (`useTabDragEndToPill`) covering the composer's `[data-chat-drop-
 * target]` rect, and it handles the reference-pill protocol — but NOT the
 * native session-tab protocol. So a `reference` drop that landed inside the
 * composer was already turned into a pill and must be declined here, or the
 * user gets the pill twice.
 *
 * WORK ITEMS are deliberately NOT handled here. `InputArea`'s own drop path
 * already covers them end to end — `insertPillFromTabPayload` has a
 * `workitem` branch that mints the `workitem://<slug>/<shortId>/<ts>` pill
 * `channelMessageBody` reads back as a card — so a work item dropped on the
 * composer composes and renders today with no code in this file. Extending
 * the panel-wide target to work items would mean widening
 * `getSessionReferenceFromDragDetail` and `useSessionDropTarget` from
 * `SessionReferenceOpen` to a reference union, and that hook is shared with
 * `TeamInboxSessionDropSurface`; the cost lands on a surface that asked for
 * none of it. The remaining gap is narrow and cosmetic: a work item released
 * over the TRANSCRIPT rather than the composer is ignored, where a session
 * would have been caught. Widen the shared hook when a second surface needs
 * the same thing, not for this one.
