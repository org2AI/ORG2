/**
 * Live overlay registry for in-flight member turns.
 *
 * A member's send runs the turn in an invisible durable local execution
 * Session and
 * only publishes the agent tail to the plane at terminal — so without this,
 * even the SENDER stares at their own message with no thinking, no tools,
 * no "Agent worked for Ns" until the whole turn lands at once.
 *
 * The runner is LOCAL, so its events stream live through the normal
 * per-session events atom. This registry tells the conversation stream
 * which local runner sessions to tap and overlay while their turn is still
 * running. Once the plane carries the turn's `turnId` (the tail push
 * landed), the overlay is dropped in favour of the authoritative plane
 * rows — keyed by turnId so the swap never double-renders.
 *
 * "Carries the turn" means an AGENT row under that turnId: the user's own
 * message row is pushed under the same turnId BEFORE the runner exists, so
 * matching any row would drop the overlay the instant it registered.
