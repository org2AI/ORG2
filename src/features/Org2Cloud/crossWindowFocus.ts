/**
 * Cross-window focus aggregation for app-wide foreground leases.
 *
 * With detached session windows, "the app is in the foreground" is no longer
 * the same statement as "THIS window is focused": a user working in a
 * detached window keeps the MAIN window blurred, and any main-window-only
 * service keyed on own-window focus (the realtime connection lease) would
 * wrongly wind down after its blur grace. Every window publishes its focus
 * state over `BroadcastChannel("orgii:window-focus")` — with a localStorage
 * heartbeat map as the fallback transport — and `isAnyAppWindowFocused()`
 * answers the app-wide question: this window focused, or any peer window
 * whose focused claim is fresh within `CROSS_WINDOW_FOCUS_TTL_MS`.
 *
 * A focused window re-publishes on a short heartbeat so its claim never goes
 * stale; a closed or crashed window simply stops publishing and drops out of
 * the aggregate within the TTL. Outside Tauri (browser dev, unit tests)
 * there is only one document, so the aggregate collapses to plain own-window
 * focus and the publisher is a no-op — existing single-window behavior and
 * tests are unchanged.
