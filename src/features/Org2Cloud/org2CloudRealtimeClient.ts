/**
 * ORG2 Cloud Realtime client (inbound-sync subscription transport).
 *
 * The rest of Org2Cloud talks to the backend over raw `fetch` to REST/RPC
 * (`org2CloudClient`, `org2CloudManagementClient`, `org2CloudBackendAdapter`).
 * This module is the ONLY place `@supabase/supabase-js` is used, and ONLY for
 * its Realtime (Postgres Changes) transport — it never replaces a data-fetch
 * path. Realtime events are treated as INVALIDATION signals: a change on a
 * subscribed table for an org tells the caller "re-pull with the existing RPC",
 * so all cursor / LWW / tombstone-absence logic stays in the sync engine.
 *
 * Endpoint + anon key come from `getCloudEndpoint()` (custom-backend aware).
 * Realtime authorization runs through the table's RLS SELECT policy, so the
 * connection must carry the signed-in user's access token; `setAuth` is called
 * on connect and again whenever the token is refreshed.
