/**
 * Session-sync coverage PER REPO SCOPE: how much of this device's history in
 * each of THIS ORG'S repos is published to it.
 *
 * The rows are the org's own repo scopes — not every repo on the device. Repo
 * scope is the hard boundary the push pass matches against, so a repo the org
 * has not scoped can never receive a session; listing it would report a 0%
 * that no user action can ever move. Sessions outside every org scope (and
 * sessions with no Git remote at all) are excluded from the rows AND from the
 * totals, so the headline percentage means "of the work this org can receive"
 * rather than "of everything on this laptop".
 *
 * Pure by design — the caller hands in the roster, the durable push markers,
 * and the scope resolver, so the same numbers are assertable in tests and
 * renderable from either sync surface (org-management → Sync, Runtime → org →
 * Sync).
 *
 * The DENOMINATOR reuses the engine's own candidate filters so no row can
 * exceed 100%:
 *  - `isPrimarySessionListSession` drops subagent/worker transcripts. A
 *    subagent is a rendering detail of its parent, never an independently
 *    published unit (see `importedSessionScopeMatch`), so counting one would
 *    inflate a denominator nothing can ever move.
 *  - `isCloudPushCandidate` drops teammate copies pulled DOWN from an org;
 *    those never round-trip back up.
 *  - `decidePushAdmission` applies fork provenance and the ownership/tag/
 *    explicit-share-intent gate.
 *  - `resolveCloudPushAccess` excludes admitted sessions whose effective
 *    access remains off.
 *
 * The NUMERATOR is the durable push marker — the same evidence
 * `Org2CloudSessionSyncState.wasCloudPushed` reads — so a session still counts
 * as synced after a restart. The in-memory metadata-hash cache is deliberately
 * NOT consulted: it dies with the app, and a count that shrinks on relaunch
 * reads as data loss.
