/**
 * GC for cloud session rows whose local session vanished.
 *
 * Every retract path in the engine's push pass only runs for sessions it
 * visits in `sessionsAtom`. A session can leave that roster without ever
 * being visited again — deleted locally, or an imported continuation sibling
 * demoted by the backend election — and its server row plus this device's
 * durable push markers would then linger forever: teammates keep a ghost row
 * in Team Conversations, and the owner's other devices list it as "another
 * device's session".
 *
 * Absence from `sessionsAtom` alone is WEAK evidence (the roster is
 * paginated), so every suspect is confirmed gone through the backend
 * exact-id lookup before it is eligible for retraction. The lookup runs with
 * `includeContinuationSuperseded`: a sibling demoted by the continuation
 * election still exists locally, and reporting it absent would retract the
 * team's shared cloud row on every context-window continuation (/compact).
 *
 * Only ids THIS device push-marked are ever candidates: rows the same
 * account pushed from another device carry no local marker and are never
 * touched. A failed lookup means "unknown", never "gone" — the sweep returns
 * nothing rather than risk retracting a live row. A successful-but-empty
 * lookup is still weak while the imported-history cache is rebuilding
 * (schema migration, cleared cache), so the ENGINE additionally requires a
 * suspect to be confirmed absent on two consecutive sweeps before
 * retracting.
