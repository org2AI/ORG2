/**
 * Pure cache primitives for the WorktreeSourceModal preload / cache layer.
 *
 * The worktree-source picker preloads GitHub (PR/issue) and branch data when
 * the modal opens so switching tabs never re-triggers a spinner. These helpers
 * hold the framework-agnostic freshness / eviction / isolation / in-flight
 * de-dup logic so it stays unit-testable without React or jotai.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - **Branch data** reuses the existing app-wide `branchCacheAtom`
 *   (`@src/store/repo`, 5-min TTL, shared with `BranchPalette`) — these helpers
 *   are only the backing store for the **GitHub** cache that had no equivalent.
 * - Maps are treated immutably (`write*` returns a new Map) so they can live in
 *   a jotai atom and trigger re-renders on change.
