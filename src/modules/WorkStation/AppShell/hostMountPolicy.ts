/**
 * hostMountPolicy — pure predicates deciding which WorkStation content hosts
 * (code / browser / project / Agent Station simulator) are mounted at all.
 *
 * The AppShell keeps previously-visited hosts mounted-but-hidden so tab
 * switches stay instant. That keep-alive used to be monotonic: once a host
 * mounted it never unmounted, the code host was mounted from launch, and the
 * Browser host was unconditionally pre-mounted. These predicates bound the
 * keep-alive instead: with no real tabs there is nothing to keep warm, so
 * every host unmounts and the Launchpad owns the surface — releasing the
 * hidden subtrees (file tree, sidebars, simulator grid) and their idle
 * background work.
 *
 * The predicates are pure so the mount matrix is unit-testable; the atoms
 * feeding them live in `@src/store/workstation/tabHost`.

/**
 * Agent Station simulator: mounted exactly when it is displayed.
 *
 * This host is the most expensive keep-alive in the app, so it gets no warm
 * window at all. The simulator grid mounts one full `ChatHistory` per cell —
 * its own virtualizer, projection pipeline, replay interval, and
 * `runtimeMemoryStats` entry — and the layout enum goes up to `3x4`, so a
 * hidden simulator can hold twelve of them. It previously stayed mounted
 * whenever a session was attached, which kept all of that alive for the entire
 * time the user was in the code editor or behind a maximized chat panel.
 *
 * Unmounting is safe because the simulator is a pure view: every event it
 * renders lives in the EventStore (kept warm by the snapshot cache's own LRU),
 * and it owns no subscription or interval that has to outlive its subtree. The
 * keep-alive was buying back a React tree rebuild from already-warm data, not
 * avoiding a refetch.
 *
 * Actual Workstation visibility is independent of chat layout: a floating
 * workstation remains displayed while the chat fills the primary region.
 * Collapsing it or opening Settings releases this stateless view.
