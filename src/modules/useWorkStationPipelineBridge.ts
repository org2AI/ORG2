/**
 * useWorkStationPipelineBridge
 *
 * Keeps the live "pipeline" atom (`activeSessionIdAtom`) in sync with
 * WorkStation's remembered selection (`workstationActiveSessionIdAtom`)
 * whenever WorkStation is the visible view.
 *
 * Two scenarios this covers:
 *
 *   1. View transition INTO WorkStation: a secondary surface (kanban
 *      detail panel, project-manager tab, etc.) may have temporarily
 *      claimed the pipeline atom to render some other session's chat.
 *      On return to WorkStation, restore pipeline = memory so the
 *      docked ChatPanel and SessionSyncProvider point at the
 *      session WorkStation actually wants to show.
 *
 *   2. Memory change WHILE the user is in WorkStation: any caller
 *      that writes `workstationActiveSessionIdAtom` directly
 *      (ActionSystem, scripted nav, programmatic open) will have
 *      its change reflected in the live pipeline without needing to
 *      remember to write both atoms.
 *
 * Owner sites (sidebar click, tab change, launch flow) write both
 * atoms eagerly so the chat updates in lockstep with the navigation;
 * this bridge is the safety net for everything else.
 *
 * Extracted into its own hook so it can be unit-tested against a
 * vanilla Jotai store without instantiating the full AppShell tree.
