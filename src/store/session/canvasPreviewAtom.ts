/**
 * canvasPreviewAtom — stores the latest canvas payload emitted by the agent
 * via `render_inline_canvas`. Set by `openInSimulatorCanvas` in toolHandlers.
 *
 * - In WorkStation Build panel (SimulatorMessages), the payload is forwarded
 *   to MessageViewer as `canvasPayload` and rendered inline at the end of
 *   the message stream.
 * - UI consumers derive session-scoped state and actions through
 *   `useCanvasForTurn`.
 *
 * Cleared when the user closes the card or the session resets.
