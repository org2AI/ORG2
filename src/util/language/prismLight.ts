/**
 * React renderer for the app's Prism engine.
 *
 * `import { Prism } from "react-syntax-highlighter"` resolves through the
 * package barrel, which statically imports every refractor grammar (~280
 * modules) plus a bundled highlight.js build and the async-loader variants.
 * The `prism-light` entry is the same component over an empty `refractor`
 * singleton; the grammars it can render are exactly the ones registered in
 * `./prismGrammars`, which is also what the HTML-string path
 * (`./prismHtml`) uses — one engine, one grammar set.
 *
 * An unregistered language is not an error: react-syntax-highlighter checks
 * `listLanguages()` first and renders the code as plain text.
