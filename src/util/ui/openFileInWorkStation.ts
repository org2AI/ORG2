/**
 * openFileInWorkStation — open a file as a Code Editor tab while keeping the
 * caller on the current route.
 *
 * Unlike {@link openFileInEditor}, which dispatches an `open-file-in-editor`
 * CustomEvent that ultimately fires `action-system-navigate` to
 * `/orgii/workstation/code`, this helper writes directly to the workstation
 * layout atom. That means:
 *
 *   - the file tab is added to the main pane and becomes active (the visible
 *     content host follows the active tab, so this reveals the Code Editor)
 *   - the station mode is flipped to `"my-station"` so the WorkStation is
 *     actually visible
 *   - the chat-panel slot is un-maximized so the WorkStation pane on the
 *     right is exposed (caller may have been viewing Settings full-width)
 *   - **no navigation occurs** — the current route (e.g. settings) stays put
 *
 * Use this from the Settings / Integrations surfaces, where the WorkStation
 * is already visible in the right pane and we want to act on a file without
 * yanking the user out of their current view.
